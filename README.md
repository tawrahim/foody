# Food finder application
This application is to test my understanding of the ruby language
Nothing really fancy! It explores the basic principles of oop in
the ruby language. OMG! it is heavily commented. Hope you enjoy!

## Installation
```bash
$ bash < <(curl --silent https://raw.github.com/tawrahim/foody/master/install.sh)
```

## Philosophy
* code with ruby
* test with rspec
* document with RDoc
* If you repeat yourself more than three times, there is a better way to do it. refactor!
* push code to github every night
* Repeat
